Ayomikun's cluster tools for UW GS server

IMPORTANT (you'll only do this once):
1) Clone the cl-tools repo in your HOME directory '~/'
2) Run `bash setup.sh`
3) Run `source ~/.bash_profile` | why? this gets your bash to restart; you will only do this the first time after setting up
4) Get going with having a slightly more convenient life on the cluster!

Infrequently asked questions:

Q: Why did I make this?
A: I have a poor memory and am lazy to the point of action. The action here is enabling my laziness.

Q: Can I have some stuff added?
A: Yes, email me (ay o aki [a t] u w [dot] ed u)

Q: What do I have to do if there's an update?
A: git pull if you want it; do nothing if else
