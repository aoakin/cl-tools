IMPORTANT (you'll only do this once):
1) Clone the cl-tools repo in your HOME directory '~/'
2) Run `bash setup.sh`
3) Run `source ~/.bash_profile` | why? this gets your bash to restart; you will only do this the first time after setting up
4) Get going with having a slightly more convenient life on the cluster!
